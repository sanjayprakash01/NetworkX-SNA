NETWORKX EXPERIMENTS

1.	Use NetworkX to create an undirected graph with three nodes and two edges.
2.	Add two more nodes and one more edge to the existing graph. Visualize the graph using the networkx.draw function.
3.	Calculate the degree distribution of the graph using networkx.degree and plot a histogram.
4.	Find the shortest path between two nodes in the graph using networkx.shortest_path.
5.	Identify the connected components in the graph using networkx.connected_components.
6.	Compute the degree centrality for each node in the graph using networkx.degree_centrality.
7.	Calculate the clustering coefficient for the entire graph using networkx.average_clustering
8.	Create a random graph using the Erdos-Renyi model with 10 nodes and a probability of edge creation as 0.3.
9.	Compute the density of a graph using networkx.density.
10.	Create a bipartite graph with two sets of nodes and connect nodes from different sets.
11.	Compute the closeness centrality for each node in a graph and identify the node with the highest closeness centrality.
12.	Check the degree correlation between neighboring nodes in the graph using networkx.degree_assortativity_coefficient.
13.	Transpose a directed graph, swapping the direction of all edges.
14.	Compute the Katz centrality for each node in a graph using networkx.katz_centrality.
15. Any one community detection algorithm.
